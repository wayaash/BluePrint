so this was my project for blueprint and i just made it in just one general this is because it didn't took a lot of my time like first of all i created a repo and then i started brainstorming about the ideas then i thought what should i make and I got an idea.that I should make you know temperature monitoring system and then temperature monitoring system is a good thing for me to go because it is a very big enough friendly project and then I decided that I am like adding a buzzer to it and Then I made a schematic design and it had some problems. Then my friend suggested me to do the fixes and it worked. Then I designed the PCB and it too had some problems. But later I figured it out myself. No worries. And here I go. This is my project. It's not a very big project. It's just a
smaller one.![Screenshot 2025-10-05 152424.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTE1LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f22b8482a48087fd1dc294593ae279cb20b028c7/Screenshot%202025-10-05%20152424.png)
